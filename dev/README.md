# Hello World
This is a happy little folder where I keep all my happy little things.

## Happy little todo
* [ ] Check to see if nb's can be pinned to a position by logic only
* [ ] Check to see if deliveries can be linked to camps by logic only
* [ ] Check to see if FMEs would be useful to display in full (only co-op stuff!)
  * [x] Get spawns & info for Trade Route.
  * [ ] Get spawns & info for Manhunt.
  * [ ] Anything else?
* [x] Format all `WORLD_SCENARIO` static spawns and maybe put them on the map (tons of markers, 100k+ likely)
  * [ ] Add option to hide spawns that aren't active based on clock
  * [ ] Add display for the specific animal if available instead of grouping
  * [ ] Add option to remove/hide spawns
* [ ] ...
